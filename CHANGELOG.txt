 + = Additions since previous version
 ! = Bug fixes since previous version
 ~ = Changes   since previous version

 1.0: (2009-04-10)
 
 + Reload current map view by pressing "F5"
 + First experimental implementation of color reducing implemented (requires
    additional library "Java Advanced Imaging": https://jai.dev.java.net/binary-builds.html
    Download the library and place the Jar[s] in the same directory as TrekBuddyAtlasCreator
 + Experimental: Color reduced (<16) png files are saved using an own implementation
    that writes real 4 bit PNG files (instead to the default Java one that only creates
    8 bit or true color files)    
 ~ Maximum map size reduced to 32767 (1 pixel less)
 ~ Atlas output format can now be specified: Tared or untared atlas. The created atlas 
    is always created in the folder "atlases" - the folder "atlasestared" is no longer used.
 ~ "ozi" / "tac_tmp" directory no longer used. Instead one temporary tar file per map 
    layer is created (and later deleted) in the default system temp directory
 ~ fixed GoogleMapMaker map source
 + added map source OSM hiking: http://opentiles.com/nop/    
 + added map source OpenArialMap    
 ! Loading tile store information in settings dialog blocked GUI

 0.9.7: (2009-03-05)
 
 + New map sources (full support): Microsoft Maps, Earth, Hybrid, 
    Cycloatlas (Czech Republic only)
 + New map sources (partial support): Multimap.com
 ~ Google Maps, Earth & MapsChina urls updated
 ~ Custom tile size selection controls combined  
 + Window position, size and state (maximized or not) is saved
 + Preview map allows zoom move/zoom via keyboard controls (patch by Martin Loetzsch)
 + Fullscreen mode hides left panel and places control inside the preview map 
    (patch by Martin Loetzsch)
 ~ Fixed several Swing thread safety problems (patch by Martin Loetzsch)  

 0.9.6: (2009-01-08)
 
 + New map source: Google Terrain
 + Download error counter added to atlas progress dialog
 ! Updated OpenCycleMap url (fixes zoom level > 13)
 + New map source: Yahoo Maps
 + New map source: Google Maps China (Ditu)
 + New map source (Germany only): Outdooractive.com
 ~ Exceptions that occur while downloading/creating an atlas are now displayed
    in an dialog showing detailed information about the system and the exception
 ~ Updated Google Maps url & removed "Galileo" appendix
 + Selected/entered tile size is now saved/restored in/from settings.xml  
 ~ New experimental implementation for creating tile of custom size. 
    Disdvantage: Much slower that the algorithm before
    Advantage: Only constant memory needed (approx. less than 10 MB)   
 ~ Using custom tile size now does not concert the tiles to png format. 
    Instead the format used by the maps source is used.
 + Tooltip of "tiles-to-download-counter-label" (located right to the label 
    "Zoom levels (..)") now shows the breakdown of the number of tiles
    to the different zoom levels including the area calculation   

 0.9.5: (2008-10-27)

 + Detailed log files can be created by providing a configuration file log4j.xml
     (see README.txt for details).
 + HTTP Proxy (host & port) can be specified via GUI
 + Added information about amount of tiles and total size for each tile source store 
    in Settings window.
 + Multithreaded download of tiles implemented (number of parallel download threads
    changeable via settings dialog
 ~ Tile download system now reuses HTTP connections for HTTP 1.1 servers instead of 
    opening a new TCP connection for each tile  
 ! Selection of whole world resulted in a wrong max longitude (-180 instead of 180)
 ! Tile number and index calculations near to the border of the world corrected 
 ! Saving profiles works now (including map source, zoom levels and tile size) 
 ! Aborting of stalled downloads works now as expected
 
 0.9.1: (2008-10-17)

 ! Fixed wrong calculation of number of tiles when the amount was large. 
 
 0.9 alpha: (2008-10-15)
 + Added resizeable GUI
 + Added possibility to select map area by selection an area with mouse
 + Added tmi files for the tared atlases which make the  map loading faster
 
 ~ Changed preview viewer to JMapViewer. It has several advantages:
    different map sources 
    preview loads in background automatically
    easy zooming (mouse wheel) and movement (right mouse button)
 ~ Tar generation rewritten, each tar is now only opened one time, not 
   once for each tile to be added (increases tar creation in case of a virus 
   scanner being active)
 
 0.8:
 + Added xml based settings file via Java Properties
 + Added possibility to change tile size for the downloaded tiles.
 + Added possibility to set map size in atlas. Giving the possibility to create large atlases 
  
 ! Fixed the non working setting tile store enabled. It was always enabled, despite of what was written in the settings file
 ! Fixed (hopefully) the generation of mixed up atlases at some Linux operating system(s).
 ! Fixed bugs related to defect profiles in profiles.xml file by adding some validation of the xml data at application start.
  
0.7:
 + Added possibility to abort an ongoing download of Atlas
 + Added label that shows how many tiles that will be downloaded with current lat, long & zoom settings 
 + Added persistent tile store (cache of tiles in a store which is persistent between program sessions) 

 ! Fixed wrong download link to ditu.google.com
 
  0.61:
 + Added a possibility to select to download tiles from either ditu.google.com or maps.google.com
  
 ! Fixed hard coded look and feel, which resulted in an javax.swing.UnsupportedLookAndFeelException at other environments then Windows
