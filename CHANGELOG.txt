 * Fixed wrong calculation of number of tiles when the amount was large. 

TrekBuddy Atlas Creator v 0.9 alpha
 
 * GUI is now resizeable
 * preview map uses now JMapViewer component which has several advantages:
   + different map sources 
   + preview loads in background automatical
   + easy zooming (mouse wheel) and movement (right mouse button)
 * map selection can be done by selecting an area
 * tmi files for faster map loading are created
 * tar generation rewritten, each tar is now only opened one time, not 
   once for each tile to be added (increases tar creation in case of a virus 
   scanner being active)
