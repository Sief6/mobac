<h1>TrekBuddy Atlas Creator - Readme</h1>
<p>This is the readme file for the TrekBuddy Atlas Creator (TAC)
application. <br>
TAC is an open source project hosted on SourceForge.net: <br>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/trekbuddyatlasc/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/trekbuddyatlasc/</a>
</p>

<h2>License</h2>
<p>TrekBuddy Atlas Creator (TAC) is under GNU General Public License
Version 2 (GPL). For details on the GPL see the license file <a
	href="gpl.txt">gpl.txt</a></p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This application creates atlases for the J2ME application <a
	href="http://www.trekbuddy.net">TrekBuddy</a></p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>This application requires that a Java Runtime Environment version
6 (v1.6) or higher is installed on the computer.</p>
<p>For reducing the color depth of downloaded tiles the library
files of the "Java Advanced Imaging" (JAI) have to be present on the
system respectively in the same directory as
TrekBuddy_Atlas_Creator.jar. Ready to use binary builds of the Java
Advanced Imaging library can be obtained at <a
	href="https://jai.dev.java.net/binary-builds.html">https://jai.dev.java.net/binary-builds.html</a>
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Copy or move the unzipped files to a folder where you would like
to have TAC installed.</p>

<h2>Application start</h2>
<p>The application is started by executing the <tt>start.cmd</tt> in
a Windows environment or the <tt>start.sh</tt> under an Linux / Unix
environment. At the first application start all necessary files and
folders are automatically created by the application.</p>

<h2>Using Atlases with TrekBuddy</h2>
<p>After having downloaded and created an atlas the files belonging
to the atlas can be found in the directory "atlases\[Current date and
time]".</p>
<p>The atlas itself consists of the the atlas startup file <tt>cr.tar</tt>
(tar format) or <tt>cr.tba</tt> (regular/untared format) and the
subdirectories containing the different maps of the atlas. For using the
atlas with TrekBuddy copy the whole directory onto your J2ME device and
open <tt>cr.tar</tt>/<tt>cr.tba</tt> (in the atlas root directory) in
TrekBuddy as atlas.</p>

<h2>Enhancement requests</h2>
<p>If you are missing the map provider of your choice or have other
enhancement ideas for TrekBuddy Atlas Creator feel free te open an <a
	href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=238075&amp;atid=1105497">Feature
Request Ticket</a> at SourceForge.</p>

<h2>Problems, Bugs &amp; Errors</h2>
<p>In case of unexpected errors while executing TrekBuddy Atlas
Creator you may get presented a exception dialog containing detailed
information about the problem. In such a case please create a new <a
	href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=238075&amp;atid=1105494">ticket
in the Bug Tracker</a> at SourceForge. Please add the detailed exception
information and a detailed description of your last performed actions.</p>

<p>If you do not get such a exception dialog but have other general
problems using TrekBuddy Atlas Creator you can activate the logging
mechanism. To do so download the file <a
	href="https://trekbuddyatlasc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/trekbuddyatlasc/trunk/log4j.xml">log4j.xml</a>
and save it in the directory where the jar file of TrekBuddy Atlas
Creator is installed to.</p>
<p>The next start TrekBuddy Atlas Creator will create a log file in
the current directory (on Windows this is usually the directory where
the JAR file is located on Linux usually the profile directory). Please
note that the log file is erased on each program start. If you think you
have found a bug please file it in the <a
	href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=238075&amp;atid=1105494">bug
tracker at SourceForge</a>.</p>

<h2>Known problems and limitations</h2>
<h3>New map sources</h3>
<p>TrekBuddy Atlas Creator is limited to map sources that provide
their maps if form of map tiles. Each of that map tiles has to be of
size 256x256 pixels. Additionally the map source has to use the Mercator
projection and the number of tiles forming the world on each zoom level
has to be one of the following values: 2<sup>0</sup>, 2<sup>1</sup>, 2<sup>2</sup>
... 2<sup>21</sup>, 2<sup>22</sup>.</p>

<h2>Details for advanced users</h2>
<p>Google often changes the url that is used to access the map
tiles. Therefore it may happen that Trekbuddy Atlas Creator is unable to
load tiles from Google and there is no new release that fixes this
problem. In such a case advanced users can open the file <tt>TrekBuddy_Atlas_Creator.jar</tt>
with an archive program like WinZip/WinRAR/7Zip... and select the file <tt>tac\mapsources.properties</tt>.
This text file contains the map url templates for different map sources.
Each url template contains a specific number of placeholders
encapsulated by curly brace: <b>{$servernum}</b> for the server number
(0-3), <b>{$x}</b> and <b>{$y}</b> for the tile coordinate and <b>{$z}</b>
for the zoom level.</p>
