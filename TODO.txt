Importance order: 

1:

* Settings for tile store. Not just enable or disable, maybe a possibility to configure the amount of tiles
  per map source and / or tile store size in bytes. And to have this store as working as a LRU.
  -> JMapViewer does implement a nice caching algo including tests if a tile on the server is newer than
     the one in the cache. May be we can reuse some of JMapViewer's functionality?  

2:

* Would it be possible to add ability to switch some layers to photo maps? I think it would be useful 
  addition

3:

* Add possibility to enter download string for tile repository. (If needed anymore, I have not investigated
  how the URL to the tiles are resolved at the moment.)
  -> custom TileSource implementation should do the trick

4:

* But there's one important feature I'm missing: Like with TB-Cutter I need to be able to select the color
  depth (4 bpp is sufficient for maps). So tars would have only half of the current size!
  -> That is not that simple in Java. The standard way would be to integrate an Java Advanced Imaging API
     implementation (example implementation provided by Sun: https://jai-core.dev.java.net/ )

5:

* Open folder in AtlasProgress is platform specific (Windows only)
  -> Requires platform detection - Windows, Linux (KDE), Linux (Gnome), ...
