* Open folder in AtlasProgress is platform specific (Windows only)

* But there's one important feature I'm missing: Like with TB-Cutter I need to be able to select the color depth (4 bpp is sufficient for maps). So tars would have only half of the current size!

* Would it be possible to add ability to switch some layers to photo maps? I think it wold be usefull addition

* Add 4 threaded simultaneous download of tiles.

* Add possibility to enter download string for tile repository.
