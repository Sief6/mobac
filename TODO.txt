Importance order: 

1:

* Settings for tile store. Not just enable or disable, maybe a possibility to configure the amount of tiles
  per map source and / or tile store size in bytes. And to have this store as working as a LRU

2:

* Would it be possible to add ability to switch some layers to photo maps? I think it would be useful 
  addition

3:

* Add possibility to enter download string for tile repository. (If needed anymore, I have not investigated
  how the URL to the tiles are resolved at the moment.)

4:

* Add 4 threaded simultaneous download of tiles. (is this already implemented?)

5:

* But there's one important feature I'm missing: Like with TB-Cutter I need to be able to select the color
  depth (4 bpp is sufficient for maps). So tars would have only half of the current size!

6:

* Open folder in AtlasProgress is platform specific (Windows only)
