Importance order: 

1:

* Settings for tile store. Not just enable or disable, maybe a possibility to configure the amount of tiles
  per map source and / or tile store size in bytes. And to have this store as working as a LRU.
  -> JMapViewer does implement a nice caching algo including tests if a tile on the server is newer than
     the one in the cache. May be we can reuse some of JMapViewer's functionality?  
	 Real LRU is difficult only with the attributes provided by file system. From my point of view this 
	 would require a embeddable database like H2 <http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html> 

2:

* Would it be possible to add ability to switch some layers to photo maps? I think it would be useful 
  addition

3:

* Add possibility to enter download string for tile repository. Useful for creating atlases from
  a  local tile map server (e.g. Kosmos) 
  -> implementation: MapSources.Custom(..)

4:

* But there's one important feature I'm missing: Like with TB-Cutter I need to be able to select the color
  depth (4 bpp is sufficient for maps). So tars would have only half of the current size!
  -> That is not that simple in Java. I did not found a library that allows "save as 4bpp PNG", 
     therefore we first need a color reducing component (aka "color quantizer") that merges similar 
     colors into one (in difference to a ditherer). For saving a reduced image the default java 
     PNG writer may be usable.   

5:

* Open folder in AtlasProgress is platform specific (Windows only)
  -> Requires platform detection - Windows, Linux (KDE), Linux (Gnome), ...
     System.getProperty("os.name");
