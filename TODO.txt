1) "history" of atlas names (drop down oft last 7-20 names), useful when creating 
   updates or multiple atlases that shall be related to each other
   
   -> May be in a future release. Currently atlas names can be saved via profiles.
    
2) Option "reload tiles older than x days" for each map source - google earth 
   is seldomly updated, tiles of 1 week are often same as tiles of 4 months age. 
   More advanced solution: get some few tiles, test whether they differ to tile in cache, 
   and only get other tiles if difference detected.
   
   -> JMapViewer (preview component) already has such a function but it is not 
      possible to reuse that function for TAC  

3) Settings for tile store. Not just enable or disable, maybe a possibility to configure the amount of tiles
   per map source and / or tile store size in bytes. And to have this store as working as a LRU.
   -> JMapViewer does implement a nice caching algo including tests if a tile on the server is newer than
      the one in the cache. May be we can reuse some of JMapViewer's functionality?  
	  Real LRU is difficult only with the attributes provided by file system. From my point of view this 
	  would require a embeddable database like H2 <http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html> 

4) Would it be possible to add ability to switch some layers to photo maps? 
   I think it would be useful addition

   -> Not planned

5) Add possibility to enter download string for tile repository. Useful for creating 
   atlases from a  local tile map server (e.g. Kosmos) 
   
   -> incomplete - implementation via: MapSources.Custom(..)

7) Open folder in AtlasProgress is platform specific (Windows only)

   -> Requires platform detection - Windows, Linux (KDE), Linux (Gnome), ...
      System.getProperty("os.name");
