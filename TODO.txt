* Open folder in AtlasProgress is platform specific (Windows only)

* But there's one important feature I'm missing: Like with TB-Cutter I need to be able to select the color depth (4 bpp is sufficient for maps). So tars would have only half of the current size!

* Would it be possible to add ability to switch some layers to photo maps? I think it wold be usefull addition

* Add 4 threaded simultaneous download of tiles.

* Add possibility to enter download string for tile repository.


Done in version:
0.9:
 + Added code to create tmi file for each tared map 

0.61:
* catched: javax.swing.UnsupportedLookAndFeelException: [The Microsoft Windows Look and Feel - com.sun.java.swing.plaf.windows.WindowsLookAndFeel] not supported on this platform
* Also, can you add another function to choose url of : ditu.google.com rather just maps.google.com

0.7:
 + Added possibility to abort an ongoing download of Atlas
 + Added label that shows how many tiles that will be downloaded with current lat, long & zoom settings 
 + Added persistent tile store (cache of tiles in a store which is persistent between program sessions) 

 ! Fixed wrong download link to ditu.google.com
 
 0.8:
 + Added xml based settings file via Java Properties
 + Added possibility to change tile size for the downloaded tiles.
 + Added possibility to set map size in atlas. Giving the possibility to create large atlases 
  
 ! Fixed the non working setting tile store enabled. It was always enabled, despite of what was written in the settings file
 ! Fixed (hopefully) the generation of mixed up atlases at some Linux operating system(s).
 ! Fixed bugs related to defect profiles in profiles.xml file by adding some validation of the xml data at application start.
